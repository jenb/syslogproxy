SyslogProxy license
-------------------

Copyright (c) 2011, Jennifer Beattie and Edmund Sutcliffe.
All rights reserved.

This program is a small utility to allow logging messages from binary-only
applications which only log to a file, to be forwarded to syslog (and thus,
potentially over a network). A regex matching facility is provided using the
PCRE library, to filter the set of forwarded messages.

This program is distributed under the BSD license, as specified below.

For convenience, a bundled copy of the PCRE source code is also distributed in
the srclib/ directory; PCRE is also distributed under the BSD license, and
its own license file is contained within the PCRE archive file.
